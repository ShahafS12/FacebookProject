MTA FACEBOOK

Developed a CLI based replica of Facebook using C++ as a college project, which allowed me to improve my skills in the language and its features. Implemented features such as adding friends, posting statuses, creating pages, and allowing users to like pages. Helped improve ability to work in a team.
