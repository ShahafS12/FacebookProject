MTA FACEBOOK

Developed a CLI based replica of Facebook using C++ as a 
college project, which allowed me to improve my skills in
the language and its features. Implemented features such
as adding friends, posting statuses, creating pages, and
allowing users to like pages. Helped improve ability to work
in a team.
